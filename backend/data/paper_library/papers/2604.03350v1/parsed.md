# 1  Introduction

Agent-based models are powerful tools for simulating complex systems based on
                        autonomous agents that interact within an environment. These models are particularly important for studying emergent phenomena when local interactions
                             give rise to global behaviors that are often difficult to capture with traditional
                             analytical methods [4]. In ecology and socio-environmental systems, ABMs are
                             particularly appealing because they allow researchers to relax strong analytical
                          assumptions (e.g., well-mixed populations or perfect rationality) and explicitlyarXiv:2604.03350v1                            represent space, stochasticity, and interaction networks [2]. Despite their flexibility, ABMs are often criticized for lacking systematic exploration protocols,
                       making it difficult to assess the robustness, generality, and policy relevance of
                              their results [14].
                              In this paper, we propose a general protocol for model exploration that systematically investigates the behavior of agent-based simulation models as a function of actionable parameters. Rather than focusing on empirical calibration or
                             prediction, our objective is to support exploratory analysis and what-if  reasoning. The proposed protocol is designed to be transferable across simulation

models for which external levers, such as regulatory, legal, or institutional constraints, can be meaningfully applied. To illustrate this protocol, we rely on a
deliberately simple toy model inspired by predator–prey dynamics with renewable resources [7]. We aim to enhance the credibility of model predictions by
systematically quantifying their sensitivity to parameter variability and intrinsic stochasticity. To support reproducibility, the open-source research pipeline,
including the NetLogo simulation model [20,13], analysis scripts, datasets, and
supplementary figures, is freely available in the online repository1.
   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 positions our
work within the existing literature, and Section 3 details the spatial predatorprey simulation used as a case study. Section 4 introduces our proposed multistage workflow: Section 4 presents the experimental design and quantifies the
simulation’s intrinsic stochasticity; Section 4.1 performs a preliminary modelbased screening using linear and tree-based methods; and Section 4.2 details
the machine learning surrogate approach for nonlinear sensitivity analysis and
uncertainty quantification. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our contributions and
discusses future perspectives.

Assessing the robustness and validity of Agent-Based Models (ABM) requires
moving beyond single-trajectory simulations toward systematic global exploration.  Still, the combination of high-dimensional parameter spaces, nonlinear dynamics, and intrinsic stochasticity makes this task computationally prohibitive [2]. In complex systems analysis, the primary goal of model exploration is
to map the relationship between input parameters and output variability. While
early approaches relied on local one-at-a-time methods, the field has shifted toward Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to capture interactions over the full
parameter space [9]. Variance-based methods are often considered the gold standard for GSA as they decompose the output variance into contributions from
single parameters and their interactions. However, calculating these indices requires Monte-Carlo sampling schemes that are computationally expensive for
slow-running ABMs. Furthermore, simpler screening methods may fail to capture
the complex, non-monotonic responses typical of ecological or social simulations,
potentially leading to misleading conclusions about parameter importance [18].
   To tackle the computational cost associated wth GSA, one can use surrogate
models for data augmentation. They generally consist of statistical or machine
learning approximations trained on a limited set of ABM simulations to predict
outcomes at a fraction of the cost [1]. To do so, Gaussian processes or random
forests have historically been preferred for their built-in uncertainty estimates,
but they struggle to scale beyond low-dimensional spaces. Consequently, more
complex methods such as gradient boosting, as well as deep neural networks,
have gained traction [1]. The latter may be less interpretable but offers the

         Automated Exploration of Parameters for Agent-Based Simulation      3

flexibility to approximate highly nonlinear response surfaces, interactions, and
discontinuous regimes (e.g., tipping points) inherent to multi-agent systems [10].
  A critical yet often overlooked challenge in ABM exploration is the distinction between sources of uncertainty. Standard surrogate approaches often treat
the simulator as a deterministic blackbox, ignoring the aleatoric uncertainty (intrinsic stochasticity) arising from random seeds in the ABM. Conversely, epistemic uncertainty arises from the surrogate’s lack of training data in certain
regions. Failing to separate these can lead to overconfident predictions in unstable regimes [8]. Furthermore, the blackbox nature of complex machine learning surrogate models poses an interpretability challenge. In this context, conformal prediction has emerged as a critical framework for reliable uncertainty
quantification. Unlike traditional Bayesian or error-variance methods, it provides distribution-free and finite-sample tools to construct rigorous prediction
intervals that bound the surrogate’s approximation error with a pre-specified
confidence level [17]. To bridge the gap between accurate prediction and mechanistic understanding, post-hoc explainable techniques such as, for example, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) are
becoming essential [5]. These tools allow modelers to visualize not just which parameters matter, but how they influence the system (e.g., identifying thresholds
and phase transitions). In this paper, we propose a pipeline that unifies these
elements: leveraging machine learning whenever necessary for nonlinear approximations while rigorously decomposing uncertainty to identify robust stability
boundaries and critical regimes.


# 3  Model Description

Baseline Model. We extend a classical toy predator–prey model [13] by introducing three spatially explicit mechanisms that drive complex system dynamics.
Two types of agents interact in this model: herbivores (bandicoots) gain energy
by consuming the renewable resource, while predators (foxes) gain energy by
consuming herbivores. The simulation is implemented in Netlogo [2,20] and is
stopped after 1000 timesteps (t) 2. The environment is defined as a square lattice
of 60 × 60 discrete patches. The simulation environment is defined as a toroidal
grid to eliminate edge effects and avoid boundary handling.
   Each patch contains a renewable resource (grass) that serves as the primary
energy source for herbivorous agents. Resource availability on patch i at time t
is represented by a continuous variable Ri(t) ∈[0, Rmax]. Grass growth follows
the regenerative process as Ri(t + 1) = min (Rmax, Ri(t) + g), where g is the
intrinsic growth rate of the resource. When grass is consumed, Ri(t) is reduced
proportionally to the number of herbivores on the patch and their intake. Each
agent a of species s is characterized by its position xa(t), its energy Ea(t), its
age Aa(t) and its maximum lifespan Amaxa    . Native herbivores consume grass in
their current patch. When sufficient resources are available, grass energy is reduced. Similarly, predators feed on native herbivores occupying the same patch,

instantly removing a prey. In both cases, the successful agent gains energy according to Ea(t+1) = Ea(t)+αs, where αs is the energy gain parameter specific
to the species s. Energy decreases by 1 every tick and increases through successful feeding. Agents die if their energy becomes negative (Ea(t) < 0) or if their
age exceeds the species-specific maximum lifespan (Aa(t) > Amaxa   ).
   Reproduction is asexual and energy-dependent. An agent has 50% chance
of reproducing if Ea(t) ≥Ereps   and  Aa(t) ≥Areps   , where Ereps  and Areps   are
species-specific thresholds. The number of offspring is drawn from a bounded discrete distribution, but since each child receives Ereps  energy from its parent, the
maximum number of offspring is therefore proportional to the parent’s energy.
Offsprings spawn one stride distance away from their parents.

Spatial extensions.  Unlike classical predator–prey models assuming homogeneous resource availability [13], grass is distributed non-uniformly across space.
Initial grass patches are generated around a limited number of spatial centers,
with the probability that a patch is fertile decreasing exponentially with its
distance to the nearest center: P(i is fertile) ∝exp(−kdi), where di denotes the
distance from patch i to the closest grass cluster center and k controls the spatial
decay rate. This mechanism produces clustered resource landscapes, introducing
spatial heterogeneity and localized competition.
   Also, compared to the dummy implementation, agent movements are not
purely stochastic when food sources or prey are locally available. Instead, agents
exhibit directed movement toward relevant targets within their perceptual range
to improve the spatialization of the model and the interactions between the
agents and their environments. Each agent of species s is endowed with a perception radius rs, defining a local neighborhood Na within which relevant environmental information can be detected. Herbivorous agents move toward the
nearest patch containing available grass within Na. Predatory agents move toward the nearest detectable prey individual within Na. When no suitable target
is detected within the perception neighborhood, agents default to a random walk.
    Finally, we introduce a spatial risk component through the implementation
of localized hunting zones. A subset of the fertile patches is randomly designated
as regulated hunting areas. In these locations, both native herbivores and predators are subject to an additional stochastic death probability, Pdeath,s, which is
proportional to the established hunting quotas for species s. This mechanism
simulates anthropogenic pressure and introduces a non-biological source of mortality that varies across the landscape.


# 4  Multi-Stage Exploration Pipeline

The primary challenge in exploring stochastic ABMs lies in the computational
cost of resolving high-dimensional interactions while accounting for aleatoric
noise. To address this, we propose a hierarchical “zoom-in” pipeline, illustrated
in Fig. 1, designed to bridge the gap between global statistical trends and local
mechanical realities.

   The methodology transitions from a coarse model-based screening to a finegrained data-driven analysis. Initially, we assess internal stochasticity using linear and simple global screening to identify dominant drivers and interpretable
extraction rules methods to segment stability regions locally. We then deepen this
analysis by training, if needed, one or many machine learning surrogate models
to capture non-linear dynamics. This second stage facilitates a rigorous dual assessment: variance-based global sensitivity analysis ranks interactions [9], while
local explainability tools map the precise functional forms and tipping points
governing ecosystem resilience [11]. This paper illustrates a two-stage workflow,
but depending on the underlying model at hand, more steps may be required,
or the first step could be sufficient.

Domain Knowledge and Assumptions  To systematically explore the model’s
behavior and the interactions between spatial heterogeneity and agent behavior,
we identify 13 continuous variables and one categorical seed variable. These parameters characterize environmental constraints, prey (bandicoot) metabolism,
and predator (fox) efficiency. The experimental variables and their respective
ranges are summarized in Table 1. We assumed a uniform distribution across
the 13-dimensional input space, E denotes energy units, and t denotes ticks.
   To illustrate our methodology, we focus on population subsistence as the primary model output, y ∈{extinction, prey_survival, coexistence} that is an
ordinal variable [15]. For computational simplicity, we encode this output numerically as y ∈{0, 0.5, 1}. Although assigning 0.5 to the intermediate state is an
approximation and sophisticated methods exist to learn nonlinear warping operators for ordinal data [15], we adopt this linear encoding as a convenient proxy
for stability ordering. This simplification does not impact the classification-based
surrogate analyses performed later in the study.


## 4.1  Model-based Analysis

Following our workflow, we analyze the raw simulation data to identify global
trends and assess the impact of stochasticity. This step informs the subsequent

data-driven surrogate modeling by highlighting the limitations of linear assumptions. We first start with a global analysis, then we dive into more local insights.

Initial Experimental Design and Data Analysis  To ensure efficient and
space-filling sparse exploration, we employed Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
to generate N = 650 unique parameter configurations (50 points times the number of variables). To account for model stochasticity, each configuration was
executed across n = 5 independent replications using distinct random seeds,
resulting in a total of 3,250 simulation runs.
   In the data, the outcomes are significantly unbalanced because 60% of the
data correspond to a total extinction, 27% correspond to a prey survival, and
only 13% of the data correspond to a sustainable coexistence between the two
species. Therefore, our first analysis will focus on understanding globally the
response across the whole search space to identify the reason for such a low
proportion of coexistence. Then, a second analysis will focus on understanding
the drivers of coexistence.
  We quantify the inherent stochasticity of the simulation to establish a theoretical performance benchmark. Since the model output y is a random variable
conditional on the seed S, no deterministic predictor can achieve 100% accuracy. We explicitly measured this Aleatoric Uncertainty to distinguish between
surrogate modeling error and irreducible simulation noise (Bayes error rate). To
determine the upper bound of predictability, we constructed a theoretical oracle
predictor consisting of the Bayes optimal classifier [19]. For each unique parameter configuration Xi, we aggregated the five replicates Yi = {yi,1, . . . , yi,5}
and computed the group median ˜yi. We effectively asked: “If a model perfectly
learned the central tendency of the system, how often would it correctly predict
the individual simulation runs?” In our model, the theoretical maximum accuracy (Accmax) is defined as the proportion of individual runs that align exactly
with their group median: Accmax = N×n1 PNi=1 Pnj=1 I(yi,j = ˜yi). The analysis
reveals a theoretical accuracy limit of 95.3%. This implies that only 4.7% of

the variance is purely aleatoric (noise) and cannot be explained by the input
parameters X.

Leveraging ANOVA for Linear Global Sensitivity Analysis.  To quantify the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the population outcome
(y), we conducted a simple ANOVA on a generalized linear model fitted by ordinary least squares. The ANOVA used Type II sums of squares to estimate the
proportion of variance explained by each factor while controlling for other main
effects [9]. Note that we could have opted for other methods, such as one-at-atime Morris elementary effects [9]. Analyzing the results reveal a clear hierarchy
of linear drivers. The Proportion of Hunting Zones (PH) is the dominant factor, explaining approximately 25.7% of the total variance. This is followed by
the Bandicoot Hunt Chance (BH, 9%) and the Bandicoot Energy Gain when
eating (BG, 7E). Within the linear approximation, these results suggest that
anthropogenic pressure contributes more to variability in outcomes than most
individual metabolic parameters. The Seed (S) factor explains negligible variance, implying that internal stochasticity does not bias global trends. A χ2 test
across seeds (χ2 = 1.25, p > 0.99) further confirms that population regimes are
independent of random initializations. However, the linear model achieves an R2
of only 43%, leaving a large residual variance (56.5%). This substantial unexplained variance indicates that nonlinear interactions and higher-order effects
play a major role in system dynamics and motivates the use of nonlinear surrogate methods in subsequent analysis. While the linear analysis highlights a
strong sensitivity to anthropogenic parameters, the significant residual variance
confirms that linear methods are insufficient to capture the model’s full complexity. This motivates the subsequent use of nonlinear surrogate modeling to
better understand these interactions.

Leveraging a Decision Tree for Threshold Identification.  To resolve the
nonlinearities identified by the ANOVA residuals, we trained a regression tree to
identify specific parameter thresholds that trigger regime shifts [3]. This allows
for studying the identified local phenomena locally. The tree identifies a primary
tipping point at PH ≈31%. When hunting zone density exceeds this threshold,
the system stability relies heavily on BH. If BH > 18%, the outcome converges
toward total extinction (mean value of 8%). Conversely, in low hunting zone
environments, metabolic factors become critical due to the fact that there is less
hunting zones. In that case, a low energy gain for when bandicoots are eating,
BG < 4, also leads toward the total extinction of both species (7% on average).

First Refinement of the Search Space.  To balance computational feasibility with statistical rigor, we determined the required number of replications,
or number of seeds, (n) using a sequential procedure based on the asymptotic
normality of the sample mean. Relying on the central limit theorem, we assume
that for a sufficiently large number of replications, the sampling distribution of
the mean stability score approximates a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the
underlying population distribution [12]. We targeted a confidence level of 95%
8       P. Saves, M. Mastio, N. Verstaevel, B. Gaudou

(Zα/2 ≈1.96) with a desired margin of error of ϵ = ±0.1. The optimal sam2
ple size n∗for a given parameter configuration is estimated as n∗=   Zα/2·ˆσϵ        ,
where  ˆσ is the sample standard deviation estimated from previous runs. Our
analysis of the pilot data revealed that the average required sample size across
the input space is n∗= 20.58. Consequently, we fixed the experimental design
at n = 20 replicates. This choice satisfies the statistical requirements for the
majority of the parameter space.
   Parts of the parameter space yield trivial extinction outcomes. Therefore the
subsequent search space exploration will restrict the operational range of PH to
[0, 30]%, BH to [0, 20]% and BG to [5, 20], to focus computational resources on
the transition zone where complex coexistence or bandicoots survival dynamics
occur, especially since the ANOVA indicates that nonlinearities and interactions
effects explains most of the variations in the simulation outcomes. Therefore,
this first analysis successfully identified the search space regions leading to noncoexistence, and our second analysis can effectively focus on understanding the
drivers of coexistence.


## 4.2  Data-based analysis

Building on our preliminary findings, we sampled a new LHS of 650 points, each
replicated 20 times for a total of 13,000 data points. The new class imbalance
is of 16% extinction, 26% prey survival, and 58% coexistence. The theoretical
accuracy limit is now 89.6%, implying a minimum of around 10% randomness in
the results [8]. To capture non-linear phase transitions, we train an MLP classifier (2 × 128 neurons, ReLU) using L2 regularization to prevent overfitting the
irreducible noise [6]. Validated via Stratified Group 10-Fold Cross-Validation,
the surrogate achieves 80.1% accuracy. Error analysis indicates that misclassifications primarily occur at the metastable boundary between coexistence and
predator extinction.
   While the surrogate classifier is trained on three discrete states, the subsequent sensitivity and interpretability analyses focus specifically on the predicted
probability of the coexistence regime, P(y = coexistence). This continuous
metric will serve as a proxy for ecosystem resilience, allowing us to quantify how
parameters drive the system toward or away from a steady state. Unlike discrete
class labels, the probability score captures subtle gradients in stability, revealing regions where the ecosystem is technically stable but highly vulnerable to
stochastic collapse versus regions of a more robust stability.

Leveraging Sobol’ indices for nonlinear global sensitivity analysis.  To
quantify parameter influence, we contrast a linear ANOVA on ordinal regimes,
performed on the new dataset, with a variance-based Sobol’ analysis derived
from an MLP surrogate (Table 2). Note that, while the specific selection of
surrogate architectures and GSA methods is not the primary focus of this study,
the rationale and workflow for such choices are detailed in our previous work [16].

Sobol’ indices decompose output variance to capture nonlinearities: the FirstOrder Index (S1) measures a parameter’s pure contribution, while the TotalOrder Index (ST ) accounts for its full effect, including all interactions. The two
methods provide sharply different views of the input–output relationship: the
linear ANOVA performs poorly (residual variance 87%), indicating that system
dynamics are largely governed by non-additive interactions and threshold effects
beyond the reach of linear statistics.
   The comparison reveals a sharp disparity between linear and non-linear sensitivity assessments. The linear ANOVA model exhibits poor explanatory power
(residual variance > 85%), suggesting a system dominated by top-down control
where fox-related traits are the primary drivers. Under this linear assumption,
only the direct effects of predation emerge above the noise, while all other parameters appear statistically insignificant (< 1% explained variance).
   In contrast, the Sobol’ indices identify bandicoot-related parameters and environmental constraints as the dominant drivers. While predation is the proximal
cause of mortality, coexistence is regulated bottom-up: stability depends on the
prey’s metabolic capacity and resource availability to buffer against stochastic
extinction. The system nonlinearity is further characterized by the important
gap between First-Order (S1) and Total Order (ST ) effects. The low sum of
first-order indices indicates that 69% of the variance arises from higher-order
parameter interactions, confirming that regime shifts are driven by complex synergies rather than isolated parameter effects. Every variable plays a role when
considering interactions; ST varies from 46% to 6.4%. Note that the secondorder Sobol’ indices account for 55% of the variance, and almost exclusively in
interaction with the top 6 variables given in Table 2. Therefore, only 17% of the
variance comes from the interactions between 3 variables or more. Notably, the
amount of food bandicoots eat (BF) is the only exception; it does not interact
at order 2 but interacts strongly at high orders. This variable looks insignificant
at orders 1 and 2, but plays an important role as a connecting factor between
grassland-related variables and bandicoot-related variables.

Leveraging PDP and ICE for Threshold Identification.  To interpret the
nonlinear effects highlighted by the Sobol’ analysis, we computed Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves from
the MLP surrogate’s predicted coexistence probability: PDPs show the marginal
mean response, while ICE curves display individual ceteris paribus deviations [5].

We then quantify uncertainty, using conformal Prediction implemented through
a dual Random Forest scheme [17]. This approach disentangles the epistemic
component σepistemic (model uncertainty) from the aleatoric component σaleatoric
(intrinsic stochasticity). The components were combined, based on the additive
                       qnature of assumed independent variances, as σtotal =   σ2aleatoric + σ2epistemic [8].
Consequently, high values of σtotal identify critical phase-transition zones. We
show these dynamics over the six most important variables in Figure 2, which
reveals critical thresholds and non-linear interactions described as follows.
• Metabolic Thresholds (Bandicoots and Foxes energy gains BG, FG): BG exerts
a critical influence at low values. We observe a stabilization threshold between
10E and 15E; beyond this range, both the system dynamics and the associated
uncertainty plateau. FG exhibits minimal interaction with BG. It shows a nonmonotonic effect on coexistence, peaking at FG ≈25E before slowly declining.
While overall uncertainty is stable, extreme values increase stochasticity. Specifically, the combination of low FG and low BG creates a highly unstable system,
whereas excessive FG leads to over-predation, driving the system directly from
coexistence to total extinction.
• Anthropogenic Paradox (Probability of hunting and foxes quotas PH, FH):
PH promotes stability in robust metabolic regimes (high BG), stabilizing the
         Automated Exploration of Parameters for Agent-Based Simulation     11

system after a threshold of 10–15. However, under low metabolic conditions (low
BG), increasing PH reduces coexistence probability. This suggests that hunting is viable only in resilient ecosystems; in fragile environments, it accelerates
collapse. A tipping point appears at PH ≈15%, marked by a sharp drop in
uncertainty around PH ≈12%. Similarly, FH favors coexistence up to a quota
of FH ≈35%. Like PH, predator control is effective only when bandicoots
are metabolically efficient (high BG). In these resilient environments, sufficient
hunting minimizes uncertainty.
• Spatial Resource Dynamics (Amount of Grassland and Plant growth rate Gr,
PR): The interaction between Gr and BG explains 7% of the total variance.
While low values for both lead to deterministic extinction, high BG accelerates
convergence to coexistence as the grassland increases. Conversely, at low BG,
excessive grassland favors a prey-only regime. The uncertainty landscape reveals
a regime shift at Gr ≈28%: below this threshold, low BG results in low uncertainty (deterministic extinction); above it, low BG yields high uncertainty
(outcome depends on stochastic fox survival), while high BG yields low uncertainty (robust coexistence). PR operates independently of BG. Higher growth
rates correlate with increased stability and coexistence. A sharp drop in uncertainty occurs at a tipping point of PR = 9E/t; below this, the system becomes
highly sensitive to the stochastic spatial distribution of resources.
   Quantifying both Total Uncertainty and Partial dependence is a methodological contribution that allow modelers to precisely identify tipping point regions
where the ecosystem is structurally unstable, providing a rigorous framework to
distinguish between deterministic regime shifts and irreducible stochastic risks.


# 5  Conclusion and Perspectives

In this work, we introduced a multi-stage, data-driven pipeline for the automated
exploration of stochastic ABMs. By bridging the gap between classical Design
of Experiments and Machine Learning surrogates, we addressed the dual challenge of high dimensionality and inherent stochasticity often found in complex
simulations. Our methodology, validated on a spatially explicit predator-prey
simulation, demonstrates that linear methods, while useful for initial screening,
fail to capture the critical non-linear metabolic interactions and threshold effects
that govern ecosystem resilience.
   Future works focus on three main axes. First, we will develop an active learning loop, where the uncertainty maps generated in the final stage are used as
acquisition functions to iteratively refine the input space exploration with minimal additional simulations. Second, the differentiability of the trained surrogate
model opens the way for gradient-based policy optimization, allowing for the
automated discovery of robust management strategies in more complex socioenvironmental digital twins. Finally, we advocate for a shift from manual, pointbased calibration toward an automated, global characterization of the model’s
behavioral space. We recognize that the choice of a specific GSA method or surrogate architecture (e.g., ANOVA vs. Sobol, Random Forest vs. MLP) remains
12      P. Saves, M. Mastio, N. Verstaevel, B. Gaudou

highly dependent on the model’s structure and the problem at hand. Consequently, the ultimate goal is to connect this framework with recommendation
tools within an AutoXAI pipeline [16]. This will automate the selection of the
most appropriate analytical tools for a given problem, removing the bias of manual selection and standardizing the exploration of complex systems.
